## Local Run
```sh
pip install lanscape
python -m lanscape
```

## Flags
 - `--port <port number>` port of the flask app (default: 5001)
 - `--reloader` essentially flask debug mode- good for local development (default: false)
 - `--logfile` save log output to lanscape.log
 - `--loglevel <level>` set the logger's log level (default: INFO)
 

Examples:
```shell
python -m lanscape --reloader
python -m lanscape --port 5002
python -m lanscape --logfile --loglevel DEBUG
```

## Troubleshooting

### MAC Address / Manufacturer is inaccurate/unknown
The program does an ARP lookup to determine the MAC address. This lookup
can sometimes require admin-level permissions to retrieve accurate results.
*Try elevating your shell before execution.*

### Message "WARNING: No libpcap provider available ! pcap won't be used"
This is a missing dependency related to the ARP lookup. This is handled in the code, but you would get marginally faster/better results with this installed: [npcap download](https://npcap.com/#download)


### Something else
Feel free to submit a github issue detailing your experience.
